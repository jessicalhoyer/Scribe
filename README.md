# Scribe

A continuation of the development of my case study project for my Full Stack Java Developer bootcamp.

Scribe is an online writing application where users can create accounts to create, edit, and delete documents and folders, and store those documents into different folders.

## To Do List

* Security with BCrypt
* Custom error pages
* Reorganizing of pages to allow users to edit folders without selecting a document first
* Custom folder and document sorting (alphabetically, by id, custom)
* More robust user profile with more information
* Updated text editor
* Exporting files
